<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My passion lies in the captivating world of natural language processing, where I love delving into its intricacies and uncovering its hidden potential. An explorer at heart, I am captivated by the thrill of investigating novel concepts, while tedious, repetitive engineering tasks hold little allure for me.
